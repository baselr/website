<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")
```

<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

## Topics

- Reporting with `rtables`
- Parallel execution of R jobs on HPC via `batchtools`

After the presentations we can dicuss networking opportunities about R in Basel; 
<https://github.com/baselr> could also serve as a collaboration platform.
